# in App Router

In the Next.js App Router environment, Sicilian must be used with the **'use client'** directive. This is because the elements that make up Sicilian, such as **useSyncExternalStore and useContext**, all require the 'use client' directive. Other than this, the syntax can be used in the same way as before.

```tsx
'use client'
import { SicilianProvider } from "sicilian/provider";
import { register } from "@/component/play";
import Input from "@/component/Input";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SicilianProvider value={{register, name: "email"}}>
        <Input />
      </SicilianProvider>

      <SicilianProvider value={{register, name: "password"}}>
        <Input />
      </SicilianProvider>
    </div>
  )
}
```

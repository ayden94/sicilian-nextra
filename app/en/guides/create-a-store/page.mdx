# Create a store

In Caro-Kann, a **store** is defined as an external space where the global state is stored. To create such a store, Caro-Kann uses the `create` function. This function takes an initial value, stores it in the internal store, and returns `useStore`. It is important to remember that the evaluation of the create function must occur outside of the component. Otherwise, the store may be lost depending on the component's lifecycle.

```ts
const useStore = create({
  name: "Ayden Blair",
  age: 30,
  isMarried: false,
});
```

useStore is a custom hook that return `[value, setValue]` tuple just like useState in React.js.

```tsx
function Comp() {
  const [value, setValue] = useStore();
  
  return (
    <>
      <div>{ value.name } is { value.age } years old.</div>
      <div>and { value.name } is { value && "not " }married.</div>
    </>
  )
}
```

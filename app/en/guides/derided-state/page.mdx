# Derived state

In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, meaning they can have properties and methods. useStore is both a function that returns a tuple and an object that has a method called derived. Similar to the selector function discussed earlier, the derived method takes a derived function as an argument.

This method allows you to create a derived state based on the existing state. It is useful for improving the reusability and composability of state, simplifying complex state management logic. Derived state is recalculated whenever the referenced state changes.

```tsx
function Comp() {
  const [value, setValue] = useStore();
  const isMarriedText = useStore.derived(
    store => store.isMarried
      ? `and { store.name } is married.`
      : `and { store.name } is not married.`
  )
  
  return (
    <>
      <div>{ value.name } is { value.age } years old.</div>
      <div>{ isMarriedText }</div>
    </>
  )
}
```

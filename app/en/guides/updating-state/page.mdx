# Updating state


## Flat updates

useStore is a custom hook that return `[value, setValue]` tuple just like useState in React.js. So, if you are familiar with React and useState, you should be able to understand the example code below without any issues.

```tsx
function ChangeAge() {
  const [value, setValue] = useStore();
  
  return (
    <>
      <input 
        type="number" 
        value={value.age} 
        onChange={(e) => setValue(prev => ({...prev, age: Number(e.target.value)})) } 
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

## Deeply nested object

When working with nested object states, Caro-Kann offers several ways to update them. The first method is to use the spread operator to copy each level of the object. This allows you to manually merge the new state value into the existing one.

```tsx
const useStore = create({
  deep: {
    nested: {
      obj: { count: 0 }
    }
  }
})
 
const [value, setValue] = useStore()

setValue(store => ({
  deep: {
    ...state.deep,
    nested: {
      ...state.deep.nested,
      obj: {
        ...state.deep.nested.obj,
        count: state.deep.nested.obj.count + 1
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Using the Immer library, which helps with immutable state updates, makes it much simpler to update nested object states. Thanks to Caro-Kann's excellent type design, the produce function automatically infers the type of the store object without needing additional type annotations.

```tsx
// With Immer
import { produce } from 'immer';
 
const [value, setValue] = useStore()
 
setValue(produce(store => { ++store.deep.nested.obj.count }))
```

The approaches we've explored so far all return a new object state based on the existing object state. As we'll explore in more detail in the 'selector function' section, by using a selector function with useStore, setValue can recognize nested properties, making it very simple to update nested object states.

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useStore(store => store.deep.nested.obj.count)
 
setCount(prev => prev + 1)
```
